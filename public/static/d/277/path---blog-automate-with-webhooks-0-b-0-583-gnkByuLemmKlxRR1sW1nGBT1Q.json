Specify a URL, configure your webhook, and we will send an HTTP POST request whenever something happens to your content.\n\n## How do I configure a webhook?\n\nGo to Settings â†’ Webhooks from the navigation bar at the top. From there, hit Add webhook, and you will be directed to your new webhook. Then choose a name, put in the information of your HTTP endpoint (URL and authentication), specify any custom headers and select the types of events that should trigger the webhook.\n\n## Why do I get an old version in the CDA?\n\nAs the delivery API is powered by a CDN network consisting of hundreds of servers distributed across continents, it takes some time (up to a few minutes) to reflect the changes to the published content. This must be taken into consideration when reacting to webhooks. In normal conditions, there could be a reasonable delay of 2 to 5 minutes.\n\nExtracted from the [Webhooks FAQ](https://www.contentful.com/faq/webhooks/ \"Webhooks FAQ\")."},"author":{"title":"Web Developer","phone":"0176 / 1234567","company":"ACME"},"heroImage":{"sizes":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/hqbf17jvtgzp/4shwYI3POEGkw0Eg6kcyaQ/fc01337095a22595c4753a3f8d440362/felix-russell-saw-112140.jpg?w=800&q=50","srcWebp":"//images.ctfassets.net/hqbf17jvtgzp/4shwYI3POEGkw0Eg6kcyaQ/fc01337095a22595c4753a3f8d440362/felix-russell-saw-112140.jpg?w=800&q=50&fm=webp"},"description":"Tattooed man walking in a field","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/hqbf17jvtgzp/4shwYI3POEGkw0Eg6kcyaQ/fc01337095a22595c4753a3f8d440362/felix-russell-saw-112140.jpg","fileName":"felix-russell-saw-112140.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e2cd30c3-913d-5f6f-9230-f3ed1c91a35c"}}
